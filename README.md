## Q2BSP class
The Q2BSP class is still WIP but built in a way that allows
easily extending it. Purpose of this class is loading all the information
required for the projects described here. 
For every lump that can be loaded and that does not need
a compiler for exporting, the class also contains 
methods for saving it in a valid Quake 2 BSP file.

## [Custom software renderer](docs/renderer.md)
![Whole-map rendering](imgs/stack_perspective.png)
The original goal of this sub-project was writing
a simple renderer for radar images (top-down views
of a map that allows seeing all paths where a player can
walk on a map). After achieving this, the project was
extended to a renderer featuring custom z-buffering and orthographic and
 perspective projection as well as
rotation, translation and scaling transformations.

It builds on the Python Image Library (PIL) that allows
drawing colored polygons on an image and does not allow
real-time rendering.

## [Modifying BSP Files](docs/modifying.md)
![In-game screenshot of monochrome textures](imgs/monochrome_textures.jpg)
Intention of this sub-project was finding various ways of editing BSP files that
don't require recompiling them. This includes surface specific flags like transparency,
volume specific contents and modifying textures and lightmaps.

## Additional ideas
There are numerous ways to extending this project. Some of them are:

- porting the renderer to a real-time 3D renderer like Panda3D. While this software renderer was a learning project
mostly around transformations and projections, a hardware renderer would allow more complex calculations like lighting
in real-time.

- Writing a blender importer. This would require using data the Q2BSP class already uses and be based on the desired
complexity easier than writing a bsp loader from scratch. An application of this could be higher quality renderings
of maps or even recorded gameplays.

- Analyzing how BSP compilers structure data. This is especially interesting in the context of binary space partitioning
and visibility determination. As an example, the BSP tree for a rather simple map looks like this:
